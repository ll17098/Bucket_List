# Bucket_List

My project is to create an advanced computer program using advanced programming techniques while following advanced processes to develop the outcome. My proposal is to develop a bucket list. 

User's will be able to:
-  make an account (login / signup / log out)
-  make a new list
-  add milestones to the list
-  edit milestonesin the list
-  delete milestones in the list
-  change the status of the milestone in the list

Programming Process's:
- Python (Bottle, SQLites3)
- HTML (Login / Register forms, Output / Input List)
- CSS(Style forms)
